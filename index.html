                Stephen Fleri’s compositional style blends neoclassical
                traditions with contemporary exploration, resulting in music
                that is both expressive and innovative. His works reflect a
                broad artistic range, from the evocative Phantasy for solo
                piano—deeply influenced by Ravel and Scriabin—to the modernist
                Invocation for solo clarinet. His more theatrical compositions,
                such as Kill The Meerkats for clarinet, bassoon, piano, and
                electric guitar, highlight his flair for dramatic and
                unconventional ensemble writing. Stephen is passionate about
                collaborating with performers and pushing creative boundaries to
                craft music that is engaging, thought-provoking, and enjoyable.

                <!-- Stephen began his musical studies on the clarinet before
                ultimately being drawn to the piano, commencing formal lessons
                at the age of 13. His curiosity about music quickly grew into a
                passion after delving into the repertoire of the common practice
                classical period and beyond. Stephen graduated with a degree in
                Music Studies, majoring in Composition, from the Sydney
                Conservatorium in 2017. His oeuvre to date demonstrates an
                exploration of contemporary sensibilities within a neoclassical
                framework. Phantasy for solo piano is heavily influenced by his
                20th-century piano heroes, Ravel and Scriabin, while Invocation
                for solo clarinet is more overtly modern. Other ventures, such
                as Kill The Meerkats for clarinet, bassoon, piano, and electric
                guitar, veer towards absurdist theatricality. Stephen is
                interested in exploring unusual ensembles, collaborating closely
                with performers, and, above all, creating music that he and
                others enjoy listening to. -->

                A pianist with a deep connection to the instrument, Stephen
                Fleri approaches performance with a sensitivity shaped by his
                background in both classical repertoire and contemporary
                composition. Initially drawn to music through the clarinet, his
                artistic journey ultimately led him to the piano, where he has
                developed a nuanced and expressive style. His performances
                reflect his keen understanding of musical structure, phrasing,
                and emotional depth, whether interpreting established works or
                premiering new compositions. Stephen is committed to exploring
                the full expressive potential of the piano, bringing both
                technical refinement and artistic insight to the stage.
                <!-- I have taught piano since 2014 and have extensive experience
                working with students of all ages, helping them achieve a wide
                range of goals. My approach is always centered on the interests
                of my students. I consider it paramount that students are able
                to articulate their own goals and that we establish a clear path
                to achieving them. As someone who didn’t grow up with a strong
                technical foundation at the piano, I understand firsthand the
                challenges of undoing bad habits and the importance of
                establishing good habits early on. I have studied pedagogical
                foundations under Sydney’s leading pianists, learning technical
                traditions rooted in the Russian school. These have been
                invaluable to me, and I am passionate about helping my students
                play with ease and without tension. Peripatetic piano lessons
                are available in Sydney or online. -->

                With over a decade of teaching experience, Stephen Fleri offers
                piano instruction that is tailored to each student’s needs and

                foundation while fostering musicality and individual expression.
                Having personally navigated the challenges of overcoming
                technical obstacles, Stephen is especially attuned to the
                importance of developing healthy playing habits early on. He has
                studied under some of Sydney’s leading pianists, gaining insight
                into the Russian school’s technical traditions, which he
                integrates into his teaching. Whether working with beginners or
                advanced students, Stephen ensures that lessons are engaging,
                structured, and geared toward achieving meaningful progress. He

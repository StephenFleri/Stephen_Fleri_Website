    name: "Invocation",
    description:
      "I was inspired to compose Invocation from a fantastical concept of a ‘cursed’ ritual, a seance of sorts, calling forth spirit-like entities for the practioner(s) to gain knowledge of the great beyond, only for the beings to assume semi-corporeal forms, dart about mischieviously and cause wanton chaos. With parallels to the tales of Icarus, Goethe's Der Zauberling and many others, it's a theme seen in all cultures - the consequences of brazenly playing with natural order... <br /><br /> As an instrument I passionately despised practicing, the clarinet felt entirely appropriate to convey such perniciousness. Its vast timbral, dynamic and registral range always gave me an impression of a huge multifaceted sound world contained in an unassumingly-sized instrument, and I wanted to experiment with these extremes in the framework of an ostensibly ‘melodic’ piece. <br /><br /> Multiphonic use in this piece ranges from purely gestural to harmonically progressive. I REALLY enjoy using a device with such a potential to create harsh, chaotic noise in a way that’s relatively tame.",

    name: "Hiraeth",
    description:
      "Hiraeth is a Welsh word that reflects deep yearning and nostalgia for one’s homeland. The tune for this Minuet is very classically-minded. The trio’s bare canon at the octave was intended to be meditative, detached and simple, before melting into an (almost) unashamedly romantic progression. <br /><br />Creating something so tuneful in this age, where it feels not much is left to be said in the way of melody and traditional harmony, simultaneously felt too easy and too difficult for a ‘contemporary classical’ context. But I very much enjoyed the process.",

    name: "Phantasy",
    description:
      "My Phantasy could easily have been named “Hommage à Scriabin”. From his piano works, I was heavily influenced by the heady harmonies and serpentine figurations, but also the mischief and sense of creative vitality. I was also inspired by a delirious vision I had during a high fever when I was 5 years old – I saw Falkor, the dragon from The NeverEnding Story, flying around my room against swirling purple clouds. The introduction essentially details what is to follow, with hazy arpeggios punctuated by staccato arpeggios and aggressive trills. The scherzando B section gives way to an imperious restatement of the main theme.",

    name: "Swarm",
    description:
      "I conceived of Swarm as a study in building ominous tension. The melody is introduced in fragments, punctuated intermittently by tutti sforzandi and constantly set against fluttering piano filigrees. The piece oscillates between octatonic and more diatonic modes, bridged by chromaticism. After boiling to a huge climax, the piece dissolves in the same emotionally distant filigree. I wanted the effect to be of a town left in ruin, where only insects remained.",

    name: "Kill The Meerkats",
    description:
      "This piece was nameless for quite some time, but the incessant, chattering figures I composed presented it as such. The outer sections pass staccato chromatic figures between instruments against harmonically ambiguous and highly syncopated lines. The middle section presents existing melodic fragments in a miasma of stagnant piano chords and hazy woodwind runs.",
